NOTES:
-----

- HTML is the only file read by the web browser.
- href = location of the file


- python3 -m venv venv <-- creates a virtual environment

	** The second argument in the command is the location to create the virtual environment.
	   In general, I'll create it in my project and name it "venv". 
	   "venv" creates a virtual Python installation in the new "venv" folder.


To open a virtual environemnt, assuming it's called "venv", write:
	1) . venv/bin/activate
	2) source venv/bin/activate

Do not call Python file "flask.py". It will interfere with the package.
