# Read, Write, Append

"""
NOTES:
-----
- Better to read files using the "with" statement.
  ** Removes the need to "close" the file.
- open() has a parameter called "mode".
  ** The defaul value is "r" for read.
- "a" mode is used to append text to the end of the existing text.
- write mode is used to create a new file.
